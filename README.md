Holiday Shopping Simulation

Takes in seven inputs from the user.

When debug mode is uncommented, a log of every customer arrival is printed, along with which cashier is servicing them. A percentage of these customers may then move to the gift-wrapping queue.

A statistical summary of the simulation is displayed, regardless of the status of debug mode.

Example run outputs:

<p>num_cashiers = 2<p/>
<p>total_sim_time = 1000<p/>
<p>interarrival_time = 2<p/>
<p>service_time = 5<p/>
<p>giftwrap_time = 2<p/>
<p>num_wrappers = 1<p/>
<p>percent_wrap_service = 50<p/>
